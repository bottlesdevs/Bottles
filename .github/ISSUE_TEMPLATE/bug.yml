        ⚠️ Do not open issues for Windows executables not working in Bottles, if not installed through our installers. Bottles is a Wine prefix manager. If a Windows application doesn't work, it could be a Wine problem or a misconfiguration of the Wine prefix. Please visit [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org) and [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com) for more information on the software you are trying to run. For additional support, use the [Programs](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/programs) repository.
        ⚠️ Do not open issues for bugs outside of [Bottles on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.usebottles.bottles), as we do not support packages from third-party packages. If you can reproduce the bug(s) using Bottles on Flathub, then we will provide support, otherwise we will close the issue.
