### üöß Work in progress
- Layers (dependencies and programs on different layers) [#510](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/issues/510)

## ‚ÜóÔ∏è Install
Bottles is officially provided as [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.usebottles.bottles).

Read [here](https://docs.usebottles.com/getting-started/installation) how to
install Bottles on your distribution.

### Notices for package maintainers
We are happy to see packaged Bottles but we ask you to respect some small rules:
- The package must be `bottles`. In other distributions it is possible to use suffixes (e.g. `bottles-git` on Arch Linux for the git based package) while on others the RDNN format is required (e.g. `com.usebottles.bottles` on elementary OS and Flathub repository). All other nomenclatures are discouraged.
- Do not package external files and do not make changes to the code, no hard script. Obviously with the exception of files essential for packaging.
- Package version should follow the CalVer model (year.month.day) and the release cycle of the project. Bottles has 2 releases per month: one on 14th and one on 28th. When a hotfix is released, this will be appended to the release version (e.g. 2022.2.14-1). Bottles has a codename too which is not mandatory and currently only used by the Flatpak.
