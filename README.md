## üìö Documentation
Before opening a new issue, check if the topic has already been covered 
in our [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com).

Please note that some pages of the documentation are still being written.

## üó£ Help Bottles speak your language

- Integrated management and storage for executable file arguments
- Support for custom environment variables
- Simplified DLL overrides

## ‚ÜóÔ∏è Install
Bottles is officially provided as AppImage, Flatpak, Snap, AUR, deb package. 
There are also other packages maintained by our community, like Fedora and 
AUR (bottles-git).

Read [here](https://docs.usebottles.com/getting-started/installation) how to
install Bottles on your distribution.

### Notices for package maintainers
We are happy to see packaged Bottles but we ask you to respect some small rules:
- The package must be `bottles`, in other distributions it is possible to use suffixes (e.g. `bottles-git` on Arch Linux for the git based package) while on others the RDNN format is required (e.g. `com.usebottles.bottles` on elementary OS and Flathub repository). All other nomenclatures are discouraged.
- In the current development phase, the version corresponds to the formula (`2.commit`, e.g. 2.a005f01), where possible use this formula throughout the development phase. For stable and 'stable development' release you can use the version in the VERSION file and its release. Please don't travel into the future with releases. It might confuse users.
- Do not package external files and do not make changes to the code, no hard script. Obviously with the exception of files essential for packaging.
Once the package is published, you can open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles/pulls) to add it to the packages table above! Thanks :heart:!
